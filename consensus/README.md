# Flowchain Consensus Algorithm

## Practical BFT (PBFT)

The PBFT implementation.

## Brooks–Iyengar algorithm

The sensor network needs a fault tolerant algorithm. Therefore, Flowchain adopts the Brooks–Iyengar algorithm for the distributed sensor network. The Brooks–Iyengar is a distributed fault-tolerant algorithm which the precision and accuracy bound have been proved in 2016.[1]

In the Flowchain p2p network, each node performs the algorithm separately to exchange the measured value and accuracy value.
